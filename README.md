# FastTop
A custom Fetch Command with some TOP functionality which still needs fixing.
Currently in devlopmental hell because of my incompetence.

Absolutely 0 iq commits and I learned how to merge branches a few hours ago, version control? What's that? I had two fuckin folders named proj1 and proj2 two with the same exact files if one botched after a few hours of coding I'd just switch to proj2 because I'm utterly stupid, I got sick from the htop area flickering when I kept the refresh rate too high so I just turned the timer off.
